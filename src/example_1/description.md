## Hump Conversion
When you define variables, there are two regular ways to name them:
* underline -> get_name
* hump -> getName

Now, you need to convert underline way into hump way

## Example

`get_name -> getName`

`_ab_c_ -> abC`

## Understand what is needed

* create a function named `toHump` that accepts one parameter: `str`
* `toHump` should return a string as result.
